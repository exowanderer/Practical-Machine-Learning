# Practical machine learning

Practical machine learning is a set of tutorial based Jupyter notebooks aimed at teaching machine learning from a hands-on approach.
The material follows the Sentdex Practical Machine Learning video library at pythonprogramming.org.

The descriptions and tutorials are meant to be self-contained for a hands-on computing laboratory course. 

Each sub-category of machine learning is separated into separate directories; except for a specific focus on neural networks, because that field is still developing and expanding on daily basis.
